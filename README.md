Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to this little repo with my vscode settings, feel free to use
this will be poorly documented since it's just for opitional vscode config purposes :P

you will need to install some extensions if you want everything to work as intended

the user-settings.json needs to be pasted on the settings.json of your vscode, you can access it by pressing `ctrl` + `shift` + `P` and typing `user settings (json)` and some option will appear

then you just need to paste the thing and install some extensions.

if you want to have a code-styling config you can install Prettier and place the `.prettierrc` file in your project :)
